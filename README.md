Repository to store some ideas

I'm a 21 y.o. student from Uzbekistan. Now I study journalism in a local university and work as a pr-assistant in a local ad-agency. I'm very interested in IT and programming. That's why recently I've started learning Java to begin studying android later. Also I'm interested in wev-development but mobile-dev is more interesting for now.
